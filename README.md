# Hi there! 👋

I'm Luke Nyswonger, a documentation manager with a passion for technology, homebrewing, craft beer, jeeps, motorcycles, soccer, and dogs. 

## 📝 About Me

Born and raised in Kansas, I'm a proud US Veteran with over 25 years of experience in the software industry. My career has taken me on a journey through various roles, including web and multimedia development, support engineer, technical writer, content manager, and digital experience leader. I've worn multiple hats, serving as both an individual contributor and a people manager, leading small and large teams across various disciplines.

With 18+ years' experience at Microsoft, I currently lead our technical content and learning teams for Azure for Operators (A4O). As a seasoned leader, I take pride in fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation within my team.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two furry friends in the greater Seattle area. I also have two grown children who reside in Southern California. 🏄🏻‍♀️🏖️🌴
